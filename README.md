# Elytra Rover Simulation
Author: Darrel Zhao, Elytra Robotics

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a "sandbox" of sorts to help Elytra Robotics test deployments virtually rather than only gathering information from the field. This allows us to gather more data on rover fleet analytics, including rover trash pickup efficacy, RL policy, and fleet configurations.

## Demo Video
Here is a little video that demonstrates some of the key features of the Elytra Rover Simulation: <br>

## Important Note
This project is built using C# and Unity 6.0; however this repository only contains the C# code used for procedural world generation, rover drive logic, etc. All other project assets, prefabs, materials, etc. are all within the Unity project and can be accessed through Unity Version Control.
